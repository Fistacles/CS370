**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
  I was given a jupyter notebook file that would guide an agent through a maze. The pseudocode was provded to ask me to create an epoch to show the agent moving, a random direction that they would choose, setting when the agent moves and also showing the Deep Learning on how the agent would move.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
  Computer scientists analyze, experiment, and create the software and hardware we all use. The modern world would not exist without them and would likely fall apart if they suddenly decided to stop contributing to their field.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
  I approach problems as a computer scientist by breaking down each issue into smaller ones. Once the overall goal has been given, I begin to create different sections
  of what I need to work on. I start with the beginning and finish that section before moving on bit by bit. I follow what would logically be the next step, not jumping apart in different parts but sticking in one section.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
  My ethical responsibilites to both the end user and the organization are similar. I need to create a product that will benefit the end user and is easy to use and lacks
  any sort of predatory behavior towards the user. But I also have an obligation to create a product that meets the requirements they've said and is a useful and, if requested,
  marketable product.
